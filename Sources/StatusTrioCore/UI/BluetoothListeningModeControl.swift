/// The AirPods listening-mode quick switch: one capsule per supported mode, the
/// current one marked, the tapped one busy until the read-back confirms it.
///
/// It is a pure function of the `BluetoothListeningModePresentation` the controller
/// publishes — it never reads a device or calls CoreAudio. The presentation already
/// decided which modes are worth drawing and which is selected, so every rule the
/// control obeys (hide a single mode, disable a re-tap, mark the in-flight target)
/// is a rule the model was tested to hold.
///
/// The control is deliberately keyboard- and VoiceOver-first: selection is carried
/// by the `.isSelected` trait and a solid accent fill with a white label (Apple's
/// own selected-control language), not colour alone, and a mode that
/// is already selected or a change already in flight disables the button rather than
/// firing a redundant write.
