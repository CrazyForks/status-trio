# Fails when an actor-isolated method is passed as a function value.
#
# AGENTS.md: "Do not pass actor-isolated methods directly as function values.
# Use an explicit closure instead." docs/swift-ci-compatibility.md records CI
# run 34758026894, where `Binding.set: localization.setPreference` crashed
# IRGen on the Swift 6.1.2 release toolchain; the documented remedy is the
# explicit closure this script enforces.
#
# Detection rule, in this order:
#   1. Collect function-value positions: argument labels
#      (`action:`/`get:`/`set:`/`using:`/`block:`/`perform:`, the `request*:`
#      and `open*:` families this repo uses for its action callbacks, and the
#      `on[A-Z]…:` callback family) and the
#      `.map/.compactMap/.filter/.forEach/.sink/.assign` operators, plus any
#      `.callAsFunction` reference.
#   2. Drop anything that is already a closure (`{`), a call (`(`), a keypath
#      (`\.`), or a library initializer reference (`<Type>.init`). These stay in
#      `--list` under the token that was captured (`URL.init`), so a reader can
#      see they were considered instead of a second anonymous `external`.
#   3. A remaining reference is a VIOLATION unless it is in ALLOWED below or is
#      a forwarded closure value:
#        a. A *dotted* member reference (`receiver.method`) whose `<method>`
#           matches a `func <method>(` declaration anywhere under Sources/,
#           regardless of arity. The receiver proves the token names a member
#           rather than a type or a local value, and this is exactly the shape
#           that crashed IRGen: `Binding(get: { 0 }, set: loc.setPreference)`.
#        b. A *bare* identifier declared as a zero-argument `func <name>()`
#           anywhere under Sources/. A bare name can also be a type or a local
#           value, so the arity test stays here. The one exception is the
#           `on[A-Z]…:` callback family, which is judged on any arity: those
#           labels are the ones whose expected closure type takes arguments in
#           this repo (`onEditingChanged: (Bool) -> Void`, `onVolumeChange:
#           (Double) -> Void`), so an argument-taking method reference there is
#           the forbidden conversion — `onEditingChanged: handleVolumeEditing`
#           at VolumeControlsView.swift:51 is the live example the
#           zero-argument test used to hide.
#   4. Anything else is `external` and is reported by --list but never fails.
#
# Every function-value position on a line is judged; a line may hold several,
# and judging only the first let a second violation on the same line through.
#
# The declaration lookup fails closed on overloads: one zero-argument
# declaration anywhere under Sources/ is enough, so adding an unrelated
# `func toggle(_ animated: Bool)` can never demote a real violation to
# `external`. The strict direction is deliberate — a name shared with an
# unrelated zero-argument `func` is still reported — and the only exemption is
# the forwarded closure value described next.
#
# Forwarded closure values: `Button(action: openSettings)` forwards a stored
# closure (`let openSettings: () -> Void` at PopoverFooterView.swift:18, used at
# :32) or a closure parameter with its own argument label
# (`using read: (AudioObjectPropertyElement) -> UInt32?` at
# VolumeMonitor.swift:367, used at :369). That is a value, not a method
# reference, so when the reference's own file declares the name with a function
# type the reference is `external`. Without that exemption an unrelated
# `func openSettings()` elsewhere would turn the protected forward into a
# violation, and `read` would become a real-tree finding (`func read()` also
# exists at VolumeMonitor.swift:327).
#
# The exemption must be declaration-shaped. A bare `<name>: … ->` anywhere in
# the file let two unrelated shapes mask a real violation: a comment line
# (`// handleToggle: () -> Void`) and an argument label on another function
# (`func configure(handleSave: @escaping (Int) -> Void)`). `//` comments are
# stripped first, and a match must be a `let`/`var` declaration or a
# label-plus-name parameter position, which neither masking shape is.
#
# Known limits (non-goals). A bash guard has no type information, so these
# shapes are deliberately not detected rather than guessed at: a guessed
# detection is a false positive, and a guard that cries wolf gets switched off.
#   1. Argument-taking *bare* method references outside the `on[A-Z]…:` family,
#      e.g. `.map(handleTransform)` or `block: handleListener`, where the bare
#      name keeps the zero-argument rule and the shape stays `external`. The
#      recorded crash shape in a `set:` position was dotted, which is caught.
#   2. Non-argument positions, e.g. `let handler: () -> Void = probe.handleX`.
#   3. Argument labels outside the families above, e.g. `with:`/`handler:`, and
#      `#selector(...)` references, which name a selector rather than a `func`
#      declaration to look up.
#   4. A `/* … */` block comment that mentions a forwarded closure value; only
#      `//` comments are stripped before the exemption is matched.
#   5. Anything under Tests/. The scan walks `$ROOT/Sources` only, so a clean
#      run says nothing about method references in the test target.
# The CI preflight (AGENTS.md: `swift test`, `swift build -c release`, and a
# non-publishing release workflow run), not this guard, is the authority for
# compiler-level behaviour.
#
# False-positive policy: the rule errs strict on purpose. Nonisolated methods
# declared in this repo are flagged too — bare and dotted alike — so each one
# needs an allowlist entry with a written justification. That keeps a reviewer
# in the loop instead of silently trusting a heuristic that cannot see
# isolation. The `on[A-Z]…:` family is anchored to a token boundary so that
# `connectionOptions:`/`iconSize:` do not read as `on…:` callbacks.
#
# Usage: check-forbidden-patterns.sh [--root <dir>] [--list] [--self-test]
# Exit codes: 0 = clean, 1 = violations found or a self-test assertion failed,
#             2 = the arguments are unusable.
